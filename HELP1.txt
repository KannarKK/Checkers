  English draughts is played by two people, on opposite sides of a 
  playing board, alternating moves with different colored pieces. 
  The board alternates between red and black squares. Pieces move 
  diagonally and pieces of the opponent are captured by jumping 
  over them.

   Pieces:-
 There are two classes of pieces: "men" and "kings". Kings are 
differentiated as consisting of a yellow circle in middle.

    Start:- 
 Each player starts with 12 pieces on the dark spaces of the three
 rows closest to their own side. The row closest to each player is 
 called the "crownhead" or "kings row".
